# OWASP 

## Owasp Top 10-2021
# Chapter 1:
## Introduction 
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a regularly updated-report that helps developers, businesses and users understand the most critical threats to web apps.

## Importance of Owasp Top 10.
Owasp top 10 provides practical guidance and recommendations for how to prevent security risks, providing a roadmap for implementing secure coding practices.
# Chapter 2:
## Broken Access Control 
Broken Access Control means that the system has a type of flaw in which an attacker can access the unauthorised data, in which attacker can see the the sensitive data and can perform such tasks that they were not supposed to.

# Chapter 3:
## Cryptographic Failures
Cryptographic Failure happens when security issues arise because encryption (a way to protect sensitive data) is used incorrectly or not used at all.

For instance:encrypting data in transit,encrypting data at rest.


# Chapter 4:
## Injection

Injection attacks happen when hackers put harmful data into input fields (like login forms or search boxes) and the server doesn’t check or clean this data properly. This can let the attacker access or change data they shouldn’t be allowed to.


# Chapter 5:
## Insecure Design

Insecure Design means flaws in the way an application is planned or structured, not mistakes in how it’s built or configured. These weaknesses happen because the app’s overall design is faulty from the beginning.

# Chapter 6:
## Security Misconfiguration
Security Misconfigurations happen when the settings of an application, server, or software are not set up securely, even though they could have been. These issues are different from other vulnerabilities because the tools and systems are usually fine—it's the way they’re set up that creates risks.


# Chapter 7:
## Vulnerable and Outdated Components 
When software is not regularly updated or get checked for different issues then it may have some unpatched vulnerability. Hackers can take advantage of this and these flaws remain hidden until attacker's use them.
# Chapter 8:
## Identification and Authentication Failures
Authentication and session management are key parts of modern web applications. It ensures that 
only authorised users can use or access specific data or perform tasks in it.

# Chapter 9:
## Software and Data Intregity failures
Intregity failure vulnerability occurs when an application or a system uses software or data without verifying that it has no alterations in it.When integrity does not get checked, then attackers can change or modify a software or a data that tends to a unexpected and malicious results.

There are two types of Integrity Failures:
-Software Integrity Failures.
-Data Integrity Failures.

# Chapter 10:
## Security Logging and Monitoring failures
Security logging and monitoring failures occers when system fails in recording important security measures effectively, or the monitoring process is not that strong that it can detect potential threats. Due to this flaw, it is more difficult to identify attacks or security breaches on time.

# Chapter 11:
## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) happens when an attacker decieves a web application to make request in such a places where they shouldn't get access, such as internal servers or restricted services. These requests are done using their own servers.


## Conclusion
The OWASP Top 10 is an important resource that helps in identifying and addressing the most critical security risks in web applications. It provides a list that are regularly updated, of the most common vulnerabilities, guiding developers and security teams in improving their applications against potential threats.
